The tutorial is split into 5 blog posts:
1. [Global natural disaster data analysis with machine learning](https://github.com/AroojArif12143/SILP/tree/main/BlogPost1)\
For this tutorial, we will be performing some **data analytics and visualisation** on the dataset to gain some insights and information.

2. [Data manipulation with Pandas](https://github.com/AroojArif12143/SILP/tree/main/BlogPost2)\
For this tutorial, we will be performing **data manipulation** using Pandas so that the data can be used for Machine Learning in subsequent tutorials.

3. [How a single Jupyter Notebook can be used to pre-empt flash flooding and prevent loss](https://github.com/AroojArif12143/SILP/tree/main/BlogPost3)

4. [Web Scraping about Flood in Pakistan](https://github.com/AroojArif12143/SILP/tree/main/BlogPost4)
For this tutorial, we will be learning how to perform **web scraping** via Python to gather news about Flood in Pakistan easily. 

5. [Modelling and Predicting Annual Precipitation for Climate Change Analysis in Pakistan](https://github.com/AroojArif12143/SILP/tree/main/BlogPost5)
For this tutorial, we will be learning how to perform Modelling and Predicting Annual Precipitation for Climate Change Analysis in Pakistan using Azure Machine Learning.
