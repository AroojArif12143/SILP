### Project Description
Globally 101.8 million people are affected by one or another form of natural disasters. Changes in climate conditions, especially the warming of global temperatures increases the likelihood of weather-related natural disasters. This year global warming made matters worse and a devastating flood struck one third of Pakistan causing a million homes to be shattered. Pakistan experiences a monsoon season every year and is the fifth most vulnerable country to climate change due to global warming. A great degree of loss associated with the floods can be mitigated by prior prediction and warning. An easy to go tutorial on predicting a flood can serve that cause and also create awareness in this regard. 

In this project, the team aims to provide a tutorial on developing a flood prediction model and introduce Azure Services such as **Azure Machine Learning**. 

At the end of this tutorial, learner will be able to make use of such model to  mitigate the losses associated with floods by prior prediction of flood for pre-emption.

Many people affected by the Pakistan floods did not take the warnings seriously. This is a basic and introductory module in the series and aims to develop a logical understanding of how technology can pave the way for avoiding losses. We hope it will serve to be a reason for more people to understand and believe in technology :sparkles:
